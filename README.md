# Titanic Survival Probability Research

This repository contains the results of a data mining research project focused on predicting the probability of survival on the Titanic. The dataset used for this analysis is the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers and their survival status.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this research is available in the `data` directory. It includes the following columns:

- `Class`: Ticket class (First, Second, Third or Crew)
- `Sex`: Passenger's gender (Male, Female)
- `Age`: Passenger's age (Adult, Child)
- `Survived`: Survival status (No, Yes)

## Data Preprocessing

- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Converted categorical variables into numerical representations.
- Performed feature scaling and normalization as needed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Explored the distribution of key variables.
- Investigated the relationship between different features and survival.
